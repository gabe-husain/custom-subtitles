A Chrome extension that creates a customizable subtitle overlay for any webpage using your own SRT files. Perfect for language learning or when you just want better control over your subtitles!

## About

Tired of dealing with clunky video players and their subtitle limitations? This extension lets you load any SRT file and creates an overlay on your webpage with full playback control. The initial goal is to support language learning by allowing dual subtitle tracks (e.g., target language + native language, or characters + pinyin), but it's flexible enough for various use cases.

## Features

- Custom subtitle overlay that works on any webpage
- Manual synchronization controls
- Flexible playback options (play, pause, skip, reset)
- Time display with manual input support
- Progress bar for easy navigation
- Clean, minimal interface

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Drop your SRT file onto the popup or click to select one
3. The overlay will appear on your current webpage
4. Use the controls to sync and manage subtitle playback

The extension is intentionally simple - you control the timing, allowing you to match it with any video content manually.

## Future Plans

- Support for dual subtitle tracks
- More customization options for overlay appearance
- Additional subtitle file format support
- Better sync mechanisms
- Integration with common video platforms
